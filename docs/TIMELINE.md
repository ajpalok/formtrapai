- Evaluation framework

### 🔄 In Progress
- Environment setup and testing
- Bot simulation scripts
- Manual verification workflow

### ⏳ Remaining Tasks
- Attack simulation (2 days)
- False positive tuning (2 days)
- Documentation polish (2 days)
- Final deployment and report (3 days)

**Estimated Completion: January 6, 2026 (on schedule)**

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Blockers
1. **Performance issues with clustering** → Pre-implemented efficient algorithm
2. **High false positive rate** → Manual tuning phase included
3. **Insufficient test data** → Bot simulation scripts planned
4. **Database scaling concerns** → Indexed tables and optimized queries

### Contingency Plans
- If clustering slow: Reduce signature count threshold
- If false positives high: Add whitelist rules
- If test data insufficient: Use synthetic data generator
